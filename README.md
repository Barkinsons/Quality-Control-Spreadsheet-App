# Quality-Control-Spreadsheet-App

## What is it?
This is a Google Apps Script Spreadsheet App designed to faciliate Quality Control (QC) data entry and to visualize QC data.

## What does it do?
This app automates simple tasks such as duplicating and renaming sheets. It also consiladates QC data and visualizes and formats it into a readable sheet digest.

## How does it work?
This app utilizes a QC master sheet, which serves as the backbone for QC data entry. Users simply need to create a new sheet using the custom UI menu, which duplicates the master sheet and allows them to enter QC data day to day. To visualize the data, users will use the same UI menu, which will consilidate and visualize all relevant data onto a separate sheet.
